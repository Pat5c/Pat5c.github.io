        <h2>PATIENCE BUXTON</h2>
        <p class="intro-text">
            Welcome to my Portfolio! I will showcase some of the real-world, insignt-rich Data Science projects I have worked on (or currently working on), using tools like Python, R or SQL. As a data-driven problem solver, this Portfolio is designed to reflect both my technical growth and my ability to drive impact: from NLP, ML applications and predictive modeling to end-to-end data pipelines and ETL workflows; from A/B testing and statistical analysis to EDA and interactive analytical dashboards. Eeach project is curated to demonstrate my skills as a Data Scientist. Thank you for visiting my Portfolio.

        <p>
          This project leverages Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enhance the prediction of successful M&A deal completions. Using Python, I built and benchmarked multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks, Decision Trees, SVM) on structured financial datasets. In parallel, I conducted sentiment analysis on pre-announcement news and rumors using VADER and TextBlob to extract market sentiment features. These, were integrated into a hybrid predictive model, combining financial and textual data: this approach improved classification performance, offering more reliable forecasts of M&A outcomes and highlighting key financial and sentiment drivers behind deal success.

                <p>Developed and evaluated binary classification models to detect fake vs. real COVID-19 news using a balanced dataset of 1,164 articles. Achieved 94% accuracy with Multinomial NaÃ¯ve Bayes and 100% accuracy with a Passive-Aggressive Classifier on the test set. Explored model performance through confusion matrices and validated the robustness of these approaches for text-based classification tasks. </p>

                <p> This project investigates the relationship between house prices and key predictors using Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models.
Initial linear regression assumptions (linearity, homoscedasticity) were violated, so a Polynomial Regression was employed, showing statistically significant relationships between key predictors. However, the model explained only ~8.7% of price variance (RÂ² = 0.087) on the full dataset. After removing outliers (houses > $500k), the model performance slightly improved (RÂ² = 12.7%).
To further improve performance, SVM regression was applied on the cleaned dataset, achieving the best results with RÂ² = 25%, outperforming both the linear and polynomial models. </p>

This project aims to identify which skin conditions disproportionately affect specific marginalized groups, and which conditions are under-served in product availability or care. Customer Segmentation will also be completed, with the creation of an African sourced Skin Ingredients Recommendation Engine.
The project objective is to: raise awareness of racial or socioeconomic disparities in dermatological care and to highlight the benefits of African (Ghanian) sourced skincare botanicals. Final project coming soon!  </p>
