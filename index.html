    <p>Welcome to my Portfolio! I showcase real-world, insight-rich Data Science projects I have worked on (or am currently working on), using tools like Python, R, or SQL. As a data-driven problem solver, this Portfolio reflects both my technical growth and ability to drive impact: from NLP, ML applications and predictive modeling to end-to-end data pipelines and ETL workflows; from A/B testing and statistical analysis to EDA and interactive analytical dashboards. Each project is curated to demonstrate my skills as a Data Scientist. Thank you for visiting my Portfolio.</p>

      <div class="project-content">
        <h3>Merger & Acquisition Success Prediction</h3>
        <p>This project leverages Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enhance prediction of successful M&A deal completions. Using Python, I built and benchmarked multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks, Decision Trees, SVM) on structured financial datasets. Sentiment analysis on news and rumors was integrated into a hybrid predictive model, improving classification performance and highlighting key drivers behind deal success.</p>
